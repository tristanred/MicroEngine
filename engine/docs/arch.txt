Core classes overview

GameEngine

The GameEngine is a running game instance. The GameEngine instance provides
the services needed to interface with the rest of the world. 

Game-wise the GameEngine handles GameModule instances. Each GameModule is a 
container for game elements, sprites and stuff. The GameModule must be 
implemented by the game, the default GameModule class provides just the basic
draw calls for the graphical elements in the a container.

GameModule

The GameModule class is just a receiver of Draw() and Update() calls from the
engine. It must be implemented by the game developer. This allows it to draw
game elements in whatever way it wants. A GameModule may have a List of Sprites
and pass the Draw on each child element or it can avoid having a container and
call the draw on member Sprite instances manually. This gives the GameModule
full control on how the Draw/Update is propagated.
